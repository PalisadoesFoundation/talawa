            ## Our Pull Request Approval Process

            Thanks for contributing! 
            
            ### Testing Your Code
            
            Remember, your PRs won't be reviewed until these criteria are met:
            
            1. We don't merge PRs with poor code quality. 
                1. Follow coding best practices such that CodeRabbit.ai approves your PR.
            1. We don't merge PRs with failed tests. 
                1. When tests fail, click on the `Details` link to learn more.
                1. Write sufficient tests for your changes (CodeCov Patch Test). Your testing level must be better than the target threshold of the repository
                1. Tests may fail if you edit sensitive files. Ask to add the `ignore-sensitive-files-pr` label if the edits are necessary.
            1. We cannot merge PRs with conflicting files. These must be fixed.
                
            Our policies make our code better.

            ### Reviewers

            Do not assign reviewers. Our Queue Monitors will review your PR and assign them. 
            When your PR has been assigned reviewers contact them to get your code reviewed and approved via:

            1. comments in this PR or
            1. our slack channel

            #### Reviewing Your Code

            Your reviewer(s) will have the following roles:

            1.  arbitrators of future discussions with other contributors about the validity of your changes
            2.  point of contact for evaluating the validity of your work
            3.  person who verifies matching issues by others that should be closed.
            4.  person who gives general guidance in fixing your tests

            ## Other

            :dart: Please be considerate of our volunteers' time. Contacting the person who assigned the reviewers is not advised unless they ask for your input. Do not @ the person who did the assignment otherwise.
