We employ the following branching strategy to simplify the development process and to ensure that only stable code is pushed to the `master` branch:

- `develop`: For unstable code: New features and bug fixes.
- `alpha-x.x.x`: For stability testing: Only bug fixes accepted.
- `master`: Where the stable production ready code lies. Only security related bugs.
