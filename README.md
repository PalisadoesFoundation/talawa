Talawa is a modular open source project to manage group activities of both non-profit organizations and businesses.

Core features include:

 1. Membership management
 2. Groups management
 3. Event registrations
 4. Recurring meetings
 5. Facilities registrations

 ``talawa`` is based on the original ``quito`` code created by the [Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org) as part of its annual Calico Challenge program. Calico provides paid summer internships for  Jamaican university students to work on selected open source projects. They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015. Visit [The Palisadoes Foundation's website](http://www.palisadoes.org/) for more details on its origin and activities.

# Installation for Developers

You can test talawa in your own development environment. This section shows you how.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to setup the IDE and mobile device emulator on your local system, and have access to a system running the Talawa API which the mobile needs to access to operate properly.

1. **Development Environment**: You'll need to have the following installed:
    1. [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
1. **API Environment**: You will need to enter the URL of the API server in the Talawa app when it first starts up. The URL could be active on a system you control or in our test environment.
    1. *Your API Server:* Check the [Talawa API repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) for information on how to setup the API on your local machine or a machine under your legitimate control. There is a section in the README.md file that discusses installation.
    2. *Our API Server for Talawa Contributors*: We also have a test environment that our open source contributors use. Try it if you are not inclined to setup or customize your own API server.This is a development environment. The data stored on this server may be modified or deleted without warning. Information about this server can be found in the [Talawa documentation site](https://palisadoesfoundation.github.io/talawa-docs/)
