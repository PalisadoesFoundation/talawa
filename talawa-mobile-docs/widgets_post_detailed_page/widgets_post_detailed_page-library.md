## Classes

##### [DescriptionTextWidget](../widgets_post_detailed_page/DescriptionTextWidget-class.md)



This class sets up the post page.
To implement the "show less" and "show more" functions for the text,
we divide the text into two parts: firstHalf and secondHalf. A flag is set to
track whether to display either the firstHalf or both(the entire text).
