_VideoWidgetState createState
()

_<span class="feature">override</span>_



<p>Creates the mutable state for this widget at a given location in the tree.</p>
<p>Subclasses should override this method to return a newly created
instance of their associated <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html">State</a> subclass:</p>
<pre class="language-dart"><code class="language-dart">@override
State&lt;SomeWidget&gt; createState() =&gt; _SomeWidgetState();
</code></pre>
<p>The framework can call this method multiple times over the lifetime of
a <code>StatefulWidget</code>. For example, if the widget is inserted into the tree
in multiple locations, the framework will create a separate <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html">State</a> object
for each location. Similarly, if the widget is removed from the tree and
later inserted into the tree again, the framework will call <a href="../../widgets_video_widget/VideoWidget/createState.md">createState</a>
again to create a fresh <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html">State</a> object, simplifying the lifecycle of
<a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html">State</a> objects.</p>



## Implementation

```dart
@override
_VideoWidgetState createState() => _VideoWidgetState();
```
