# Issue Report Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

In order to give everyone a chance to submit a issues reports and contribute to the Talawa project, we have put restrictions in place. This section outlines the guidelines that should be imposed upon issue reports in the Talawa project.

1. Use the [GitHub open issue search](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues) — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If the issue is already reported and not assigned to anyone, if you are interested to work on the issue then ask mentors to assign it to you in #talawa slack channel.
3. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
4. For newly found unfixed issues or features, start discussing it in #gsoc-newissues channel with mentors. Please do not derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
5. After mentor approval you can create a new issue by following [issue template](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/blob/master/templates/issue-template.md) available here.
6. Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the mentors of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
