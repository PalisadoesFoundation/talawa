# Issue Report Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

In order to give everyone a chance to submit a issues reports and contribute to the Talawa project, we have put restrictions in place. This section outlines the guidelines that should be imposed upon issue reports in the Talawa project.

## Issue Management

In all cases please use the [GitHub open issue search](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues) to check whether the issue has already been reported.

### Existing Issues

1. Sometimes duplicate issues are created. Verify whether the issue has been fixed by trying to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
1. If the issue is already reported and not assigned to anyone and you are interested in working on the issue then:
   1. Ask for the issue to be assigned to you in the issue comments
   1. Ask our contributors to assign it to you in `#talawa` slack channel.
1. We regularly review issues and add a [`no-issue-activity`](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ano-issue-activity) label to them. Use the issue comments to ask whether the assignee is still working on the issue, and if not, ask for the issue to be assigned to you.

### New Issues
To create new issues:
1. Click on the [`New Issue`](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues/new/choose) button
1. Use the templates to create a standardized report of what needs to be done and why.
1. If you want to be assigned the issue that you have created, then add a comment immediately after submitting it.

### Feature Request Issues
1. Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the mentors of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Monitoring the Creation of New Issues 
1. Join our `#talawa-github` channel for automatic issue and pull request updates

## General Guidelines

1. Discuss issues in our various slack channels when necessary
2. Please do not derail or troll issues. 
3. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
