# Flutter Integration Tests (Robot Pattern)

This project uses **Flutter Integration Testing** with the **Robot Pattern** to ensure UI flows and app behavior are working as expected.

## Directory Structure

```
integration_test/
â”œâ”€â”€ app_test.dart             # Main entry point for integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ robots/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ login_form_robot.dart # Contains reusable robot class for login flow
â””â”€â”€ helper.dart               # Utility/helper functions used in tests
```

---

## Robot Pattern

We follow the **Robot Pattern** to keep our test code clean, maintainable, and readable.
Each robot encapsulates the logic for interacting with a specific screen or feature. For example:

```dart
final loginFormRobot = LoginFormRobot(tester);
await loginFormRobot.loginAdmin();
```
All robot files are located in:

```
integration_test/robots/
```
