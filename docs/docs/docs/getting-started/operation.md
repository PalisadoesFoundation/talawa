The Talawa Mobile app communicates with a Talawa-API server to get all its data. This access is provided via a URL.

When you first run the Talawa Mobile App you'll be prompted for the organization URL of a Talawa-API server. The URL to use will vary depending on the way you are using the Talawa Mobile app.

For a list of organization URLs for each scenario, please refer to the Talawa-API [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/blob/-/INSTALLATION.md) file
