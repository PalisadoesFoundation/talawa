# Method: `keys`

## Description

The keys of this [Map].

 The returned iterable has efficient `length` and `contains` operations,
 based on [length] and [containsKey] of the map.

 The order of iteration is defined by the individual `Map` implementation,
 but must be consistent between changes to the map.

 Modifying the map while iterating the keys may break the iteration.

## Return Type
`Iterable&lt;K&gt;`
