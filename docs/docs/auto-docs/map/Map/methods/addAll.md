# Method: `addAll`

## Description

Adds all key/value pairs of [other] to this map.

 If a key of [other] is already in this map, its value is overwritten.

 The operation is equivalent to doing `this[key] = value` for each key
 and associated value in other. It iterates over [other], which must
 therefore not change during the iteration.
 ```dart
 final planets = <int, String>;
 planets.;
 print(planets); // 
 ```

## Return Type
`void`

## Parameters

- `other`: `Map&lt;K, V&gt;`
