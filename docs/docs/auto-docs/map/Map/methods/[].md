# Method: `[]`

## Description

The value for the given [key], or `null` if [key] is not in the map.

 Some maps allow `null` as a value.
 For those maps, a lookup using this operator cannot distinguish between a
 key not being in the map, and the key being there with a `null` value.
 Methods like [containsKey] or [putIfAbsent] can be used if the distinction
 is important.

## Return Type
`V?`

## Parameters

- `key`: `Object?`
