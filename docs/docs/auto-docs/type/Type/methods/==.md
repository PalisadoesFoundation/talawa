# Method: `==`

## Description

Whether [other] is a [Type] instance representing an equivalent type.

 The language specification dictates which types are considered
 to be the equivalent.
 If two types are equivalent, it's guaranteed that they are subtypes
 of each other,
 but there are also types which are subtypes of each other,
 and which are not equivalent (for example `dynamic` and `void`,
 or `FutureOr&lt;Object&gt;` and `Object`).

## Return Type
`bool`

## Parameters

- `other`: `Object`
