    locale]

)


override




Start loading the resources for `locale`. The returned future completes
when the resources have finished loading.

It\'s assumed that this method will return an object that contains a
collection of related string resources (typically defined with one
method per resource). The object will be retrieved with
[Localizations.of](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Localizations/of.html).



## Implementation

``` language-dart
@override
Future<AppLocalizations> load(Locale locale) async 
```
