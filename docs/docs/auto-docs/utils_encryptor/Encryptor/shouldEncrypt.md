# shouldEncrypt property

[bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html)
shouldEncrypt


getter/setter pair




A global switch to flag the encryption.

Since adding encryption invalidates all of the previous data, disabling
it by default will help in keeping other contributors working without
any issue. TODO: Remove this and make encryption default.



## Implementation

``` language-dart
static bool shouldEncrypt = false;
```
