# Overview for `KeepAliveHandle`

## Description

A [Listenable] which can be manually triggered.

 Used with [KeepAliveNotification] objects as their
 [KeepAliveNotification.handle].

 For a more convenient way to interact with [AutomaticKeepAlive] widgets,
 consider using [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin], which uses a
 [KeepAliveHandle] internally.

## Dependencies

- ChangeNotifier
