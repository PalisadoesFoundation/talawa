# Overview for `MaterialButton`

## Description

A utility class for building Material buttons that depend on the
 ambient [ButtonTheme] and [Theme].

 This class is planned to be deprecated in a future release.
 Please use one or more of these buttons and associated themes instead:

  * [TextButton], [TextButtonTheme], [TextButtonThemeData],
  * [ElevatedButton], [ElevatedButtonTheme], [ElevatedButtonThemeData],
  * [OutlinedButton], [OutlinedButtonTheme], [OutlinedButtonThemeData]

 The button's size will expand to fit the child widget, if necessary.

 MaterialButtons whose [onPressed] and [onLongPress] callbacks are null will be disabled. To have
 an enabled button, make sure to pass a non-null value for [onPressed] or [onLongPress].

 To create a button directly, without inheriting theme defaults, use
 [RawMaterialButton].

 If you want an ink-splash effect for taps, but don't want to use a button,
 consider using [InkWell] directly.

 See also:

  * [IconButton], to create buttons that contain icons rather than text.

## Dependencies

- StatelessWidget

## Members

- **onPressed**: `VoidCallback?`
  The callback that is called when the button is tapped or otherwise activated.

 If this callback and [onLongPress] are null, then the button will be disabled.

 See also:

  * [enabled], which is true if the button is enabled.

- **onLongPress**: `VoidCallback?`
  The callback that is called when the button is long-pressed.

 If this callback and [onPressed] are null, then the button will be disabled.

 See also:

  * [enabled], which is true if the button is enabled.

- **onHighlightChanged**: `ValueChanged&lt;bool&gt;?`
  Called by the underlying [InkWell] widget's [InkWell.onHighlightChanged]
 callback.

 If [onPressed] changes from null to non-null while a gesture is ongoing,
 this can fire during the build phase (in which case calling
 [State.setState] is not allowed).

- **mouseCursor**: `MouseCursor?`
  

 If this property is null, [WidgetStateMouseCursor.clickable] will be used.

- **textTheme**: `ButtonTextTheme?`
  Defines the button's base colors, and the defaults for the button's minimum
 size, internal padding, and shape.

 Defaults to `ButtonTheme.of(context).textTheme`.

- **textColor**: `Color?`
  The color to use for this button's text.

 The button's [Material.textStyle] will be the current theme's button text
 style, [TextTheme.labelLarge] of [ThemeData.textTheme], configured with this
 color.

 The default text color depends on the button theme's text theme,
 [ButtonThemeData.textTheme].

 If [textColor] is a [WidgetStateProperty&lt;Color&gt;], [disabledTextColor]
 will be ignored.

 See also:

  * [disabledTextColor], the text color to use when the button has been
    disabled.

- **disabledTextColor**: `Color?`
  The color to use for this button's text when the button is disabled.

 The button's [Material.textStyle] will be the current theme's button text
 style, [TextTheme.labelLarge] of [ThemeData.textTheme], configured with this
 color.

 The default value is the theme's disabled color,
 [ThemeData.disabledColor].

 If [textColor] is a [WidgetStateProperty&lt;Color&gt;], [disabledTextColor]
 will be ignored.

 See also:

  * [textColor] - The color to use for this button's text when the button is [enabled].

- **color**: `Color?`
  The button's fill color, displayed by its [Material], while it
 is in its default (unpressed, [enabled]) state.

 See also:

  * [disabledColor] - the fill color of the button when the button is disabled.

- **disabledColor**: `Color?`
  The fill color of the button when the button is disabled.

 The default value of this color is the theme's disabled color,
 [ThemeData.disabledColor].

 See also:

  * [color] - the fill color of the button when the button is [enabled].

- **splashColor**: `Color?`
  The splash color of the button's [InkWell].

 The ink splash indicates that the button has been touched. It
 appears on top of the button's child and spreads in an expanding
 circle beginning where the touch occurred.

 The default splash color is the current theme's splash color,
 [ThemeData.splashColor].

 The appearance of the splash can be configured with the theme's splash
 factory, [ThemeData.splashFactory].

- **focusColor**: `Color?`
  The fill color of the button's [Material] when it has the input focus.

 The button changed focus color when the button has the input focus. It
 appears behind the button's child.

- **hoverColor**: `Color?`
  The fill color of the button's [Material] when a pointer is hovering over
 it.

 The button changes fill color when a pointer is hovering over the button.
 It appears behind the button's child.

- **highlightColor**: `Color?`
  The highlight color of the button's [InkWell].

 The highlight indicates that the button is actively being pressed. It
 appears on top of the button's child and quickly spreads to fill
 the button, and then fades out.

 If [textTheme] is [ButtonTextTheme.primary], the default highlight color is
 transparent (in other words the highlight doesn't appear). Otherwise it's
 the current theme's highlight color, [ThemeData.highlightColor].

- **elevation**: `double?`
  The z-coordinate at which to place this button relative to its parent.

 This controls the size of the shadow below the raised button.

 Defaults to 2, the appropriate elevation for raised buttons. The value
 is always non-negative.

 See also:

  * [TextButton], a button with no elevation or fill color.
  * [focusElevation], the elevation when the button is focused.
  * [hoverElevation], the elevation when a pointer is hovering over the
    button.
  * [disabledElevation], the elevation when the button is disabled.
  * [highlightElevation], the elevation when the button is pressed.

- **hoverElevation**: `double?`
  The elevation for the button's [Material] when the button
 is [enabled] and a pointer is hovering over it.

 Defaults to 4.0. The value is always non-negative.

 See also:

  * [elevation], the default elevation.
  * [focusElevation], the elevation when the button is focused.
  * [disabledElevation], the elevation when the button is disabled.
  * [highlightElevation], the elevation when the button is pressed.

- **focusElevation**: `double?`
  The elevation for the button's [Material] when the button
 is [enabled] and has the input focus.

 Defaults to 4.0. The value is always non-negative.

 See also:

  * [elevation], the default elevation.
  * [hoverElevation], the elevation when a pointer is hovering over the
    button.
  * [disabledElevation], the elevation when the button is disabled.
  * [highlightElevation], the elevation when the button is pressed.

- **highlightElevation**: `double?`
  The elevation for the button's [Material] relative to its parent when the
 button is [enabled] and pressed.

 This controls the size of the shadow below the button. When a tap
 down gesture occurs within the button, its [InkWell] displays a
 [highlightColor] "highlight".

 Defaults to 8.0. The value is always non-negative.

 See also:

  * [elevation], the default elevation.
  * [focusElevation], the elevation when the button is focused.
  * [hoverElevation], the elevation when a pointer is hovering over the
    button.
  * [disabledElevation], the elevation when the button is disabled.

- **disabledElevation**: `double?`
  The elevation for the button's [Material] relative to its parent when the
 button is not [enabled].

 Defaults to 0.0. The value is always non-negative.

 See also:

  * [elevation], the default elevation.
  * [highlightElevation], the elevation when the button is pressed.

- **colorBrightness**: `Brightness?`
  The theme brightness to use for this button.

 Defaults to the theme's brightness in [ThemeData.brightness]. Setting
 this value determines the button text's colors based on
 [ButtonThemeData.getTextColor].

 See also:

  * [ThemeData.visualDensity], which specifies the [visualDensity] for all
    widgets within a [Theme].

- **shape**: `ShapeBorder?`
  The shape of the button's [Material].

 The button's highlight and splash are clipped to this shape. If the
 button has an elevation, then its drop shadow is defined by this
 shape as well.

 Defaults to the value from the current [ButtonTheme],
 [ButtonThemeData.shape].

- **clipBehavior**: `Clip`
  

 Defaults to [Clip.none].

- **focusNode**: `FocusNode?`

  Whether detected gestures should provide acoustic and/or haptic feedback.

 For example, on Android a tap will produce a clicking sound and a
 long-press will produce a short vibration, when feedback is enabled.

 See also:

  * [Feedback] for providing platform-specific feedback to certain actions.

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Creates a Material Design button.

 To create a custom Material button consider using [TextButton],
 [ElevatedButton], or [OutlinedButton].

 The [elevation], [hoverElevation], [focusElevation], [highlightElevation],
 and [disabledElevation] arguments must be non-negative, if specified.
