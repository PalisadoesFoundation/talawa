# ConnectivityService class

</div>


This class provides services related to network connectivity monitoring
and handling.

It includes methods for:

-   Initializing the network service -
    [initConnectivity](../services_third_party_service_connectivity_service/ConnectivityService/initConnectivity.md)
-   Monitoring connectivity changes -
    [enableSubscription](../services_third_party_service_connectivity_service/ConnectivityService/enableSubscription.md)
-   Handling online and offline states - `handleOnline`, `handleOffline`
-   Checking reachability of a given URI -
    [isReachable](../services_third_party_service_connectivity_service/ConnectivityService/isReachable.md)
-   Handling the device\'s connectivity status - `handleConnection`
-   Checking if the device has any type of network connection -
    [hasConnection](../services_third_party_service_connectivity_service/ConnectivityService/hasConnection.md)
