# AppConnectivity class

</div>


This class provides services related to network connectivity monitoring
and handling.

It leverages the `connectivity` package to track the device\'s internet
connection status. It offers methods to:

-   Initialize the AppConnectivity:
    [initialise](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/initialise.md)
-   Subscribe to connectivity changes:
    [enableSubscription](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/enableSubscription.md)
-   Handle online and offline states:
    [handleOnline](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/handleOnline.md),
    [handleOffline](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/handleOffline.md)
-   Handle the device\'s overall connectivity status:
    [handleConnection](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/handleConnection.md)
-   Triggers the snackbar UI to show online status.:
    [showSnackbar](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/showSnackbar.md)

## Methods

[[addListener](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier/addListener.html)][([[[VoidCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/VoidCallback.md)] listener]) → void ]
:   Register a closure to be called when the object changes.
    ::: features
    inherited
    :::

[dispose](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/dispose.md) [→ void ]
:   Discards any resources used by the object. After this is called, the
    object is not in a usable state and should be discarded (calls to
    [addListener](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier/addListener.md)
    will throw after the object is disposed).
    ::: features
    override
    :::

[enableSubscription](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/enableSubscription.md) [→ void ]
:   Subscribes to
    [connectivityStream](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/connectivityStream.md)
    of
    [ConnectivityService](../services_third_party_service_connectivity_service/ConnectivityService-class.md).

:   This function handles the device\'s connectivity status based on the
    provided
    [List\<ConnectivityResult\>](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/List-class.html).

[[handleOffline](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/handleOffline.md)][ [→ [Future](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Future-class.html)\<[void\>]] ]
:   This function handles the actions to be taken when the device is
    offline.

[[handleOnline](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/handleOnline.md)][ [→ [Future](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Future-class.html)\<[void\>]] ]

    online.

[[initialise](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity/initialise.md)][ [→ [Future](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Future-class.html)\<[void\>]] ]
:   Initializes the
    [AppConnectivity](../view_model_connectivity_view_model/AppConnectivity-class.md).

[[noSuchMethod](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Object/noSuchMethod.html)][([[[Invocation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Invocation-class.md)] invocation]) → dynamic ]

[[removeListener](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier/removeListener.html)][([[[VoidCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/VoidCallback.md)] listener]) → void ]
:   Remove a previously registered closure from the list of closures
    that are notified when the object changes.
