# Overview for `CalendarDelegate`

## Description

Controls the calendar system used in the date picker.

 A [CalendarDelegate] defines how dates are interpreted, formatted, and
 navigated within the picker. Different calendar systems (e.g., Gregorian,
 Nepali, Hijri, Buddhist) can be supported by providing custom implementations.

 
 This example demonstrates how a [CalendarDelegate] is used to implement a
 custom calendar system in the date picker.

 ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/date_picker/custom_calendar_date_picker.0.dart **
