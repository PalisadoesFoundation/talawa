# Overview for `EmptyTextSelectionControls`

## Description

Text selection controls that do not show any toolbars or handles.

 This is a placeholder, suitable for temporary use during development, but
 not practical for production. For example, it provides no way for the user
 to interact with selections: no context menus on desktop, no toolbars or
 drag handles on mobile, etc. For production, consider using
 [MaterialTextSelectionControls] or creating a custom subclass of
 [TextSelectionControls].

 The [emptyTextSelectionControls] global variable has a
 suitable instance of this class.
