# Method: `surfaceContainer`

## Description

A recommended color role for a distinct area within the surface.

 Surface container color roles are independent of elevation. They replace the old
 opacity-based model which applied a tinted overlay on top of
 surfaces based on their elevation.

 Surface container colors include [surfaceContainerLowest], [surfaceContainerLow],
 [surfaceContainer], [surfaceContainerHigh] and [surfaceContainerHighest].

## Return Type
`Color`
