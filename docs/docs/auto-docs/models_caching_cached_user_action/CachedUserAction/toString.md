override




A string representation of this object.

Some classes have a default textual representation, often paired with a
static `parse` function (like
[int.parse](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/int/parse.md)).
These classes will provide the textual representation as their string
representation.

Other classes have no meaningful textual representation that a program
will care about. Such classes will typically override `toString` to
provide useful information when inspecting the object, mainly for
debugging or logging.



## Implementation

``` language-dart
@override
String  
```
