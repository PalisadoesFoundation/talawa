# Method: `routerReportsNewRouteInformation`

## Description

A callback called when the [Router] widget reports new route information

 The subclasses can override this method to update theirs values or trigger
 other side effects. For example, the [PlatformRouteInformationProvider]
 overrides this method to report the route information back to the engine.

 The `routeInformation` is the new route information generated by the
 Router rebuild, and it can be the same or different from the
 [value].

 The `type` denotes the [Router]'s intention when it reports this
 `routeInformation`. It is useful when deciding how to update the internal
 state of [RouteInformationProvider] subclass with the `routeInformation`.
 For example, [PlatformRouteInformationProvider] uses this property to
 decide whether to push or replace the browser history entry with the new
 `routeInformation`.

 For more information on how [Router] determines a navigation event, see
 the "URL updates for web applications" section in the [Router]
 documentation.

## Return Type
