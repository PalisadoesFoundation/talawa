# Method: `==`

## Description

Checks whether [other] has the same shape and equal fields to this record.

 A record is only equal to another record with the same *shape*,
 and then only when the value of every field is equal,
 occording to its `==`, to the corresponding field value of [other].

 There is no guaranteed order in which field value equality is checked,
 and it's unspecified whether further fields are checked after finding
 corresponding fields which are not equal.
 It's not even guaranteed that the order is consistent within a single
 program execution.

 As usual, be very careful around objects which break the equality
 contract, like [double.nan] which is not equal to itself.
 For example
 ```dart
 var pair = ("a", double.nan);
 if (pair != pair) print("Oops");
 ```
 will print the "Oops", because `pair == pair` is defined to be equal to
 `"a" == "a" & double.nan == double.nan`, which is false.

## Return Type
`bool`

## Parameters

- `other`: `Object`
