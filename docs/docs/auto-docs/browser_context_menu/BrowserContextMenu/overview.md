# Overview for `BrowserContextMenu`

## Description

Controls the browser's context menu on the web platform.

 The context menu is the menu that appears on right clicking or selecting
 text in the browser, for example.

 On web, by default, the browser's context menu is enabled and Flutter's
 context menus are hidden.

 On all non-web platforms, this does nothing.
