# Overview for `MacroExecutor`

## Description

The interface used by Dart language implementations, in order to load
 and execute macros, as well as produce library augmentations from those
 macro applications.

 This class more clearly defines the role of a Dart language implementation
 during macro discovery and expansion, and unifies how augmentation libraries
 are produced.
