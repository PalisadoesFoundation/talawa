# Method: `jumpTo`

## Description

Jumps the scroll position from its current value to the given value,
 without animation, and without checking if the new value is in range.

 Any active animation is canceled. If the user is currently scrolling, that
 action is canceled.

 If this method changes the scroll position, a sequence of start/update/end
 scroll notifications will be dispatched. No overscroll notifications can
 be generated by this method.

 Immediately after the jump, a ballistic activity is started, in case the
 value was out of range.

## Return Type
`void`

## Parameters

- `value`: `double`
