2.  Setting the view state to `ViewState.busy`.
3.  Setting validation mode to `AutovalidateMode.always`.
4.  Setting the view state to `ViewState.idle`.
5.  Validating the form using the form key.
6.  If validation is successful, disabling auto-validation mode and
    initiating the sign-up.
7.  Displaying a custom progress dialog during sign-up.
8.  Initializing database functions.
9.  Performing a GraphQL mutation to register the user with provided
    details (first name, last name, email, password).
10. Handling the result of the sign-up operation:
    -   Updating the current user with the received data.
    -   Refreshing the access token.
    -   Joining a public organization or sending a membership request
        based on the selected organization.
