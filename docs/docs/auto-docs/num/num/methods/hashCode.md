# Method: `hashCode`

## Description

Returns a hash code for a numerical value.

 The hash code is compatible with equality. It returns the same value
 for an [int] and a [double] with the same numerical value, and therefore
 the same value for the doubles zero and minus zero.

 No guarantees are made about the hash code of NaN values.

## Return Type
`int`
