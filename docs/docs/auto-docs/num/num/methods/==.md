# Method: `==`

## Description

Test whether this value is numerically equal to `other`.

 If both operands are [double]s, they are equal if they have the same
 representation, except that:

   * zero and minus zero (0.0 and -0.0) are considered equal. They
     both have the numerical value zero.
   * NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. If either operand is
     NaN, the result is always false.

 If one operand is a [double] and the other is an [int], they are equal if
 the double has an integer value (finite with no fractional part) and
 the numbers have the same numerical value.

 If both operands are integers, they are equal if they have the same value.

 Returns false if [other] is not a [num].

 Notice that the behavior for NaN is non-reflexive. This means that
 equality of double values is not a proper equality relation, as is
 otherwise required of `operator==`. Using NaN in, e.g., a [HashSet]
 will fail to work. The behavior is the standard IEEE-754 equality of
 doubles.

 If you can avoid NaN values, the remaining doubles do have a proper
 equality relation, and can be used safely.

 Use [compareTo] for a comparison that distinguishes zero and minus zero,
 and that considers NaN values as equal.
