# Method: `%`

## Description

Euclidean modulo of this number by [other].

 Returns the remainder of the Euclidean division.
 The Euclidean division of two integers `a` and `b`
 yields two integers `q` and `r` such that
 `a == b * q + r` and `0 <= r < b.`.

 The Euclidean division is only defined for integers, but can be easily
 extended to work with doubles. In that case, `q` is still an integer,
 but `r` may have a non-integer value that still satisfies `0 <= r < |b|`.

 The sign of the returned value `r` is always positive.

 See [remainder] for the remainder of the truncating division.

 The result is an [int], as described by [int.%],
 if both this number and [other] are integers,
 otherwise the result is a [double].

 Example:
 ```dart
 print(5 % 3); // 2
 print(-5 % 3); // 1
 print(5 % -3); // 2
 print(-5 % -3); // 1
 ```

## Return Type
`num`

## Parameters
