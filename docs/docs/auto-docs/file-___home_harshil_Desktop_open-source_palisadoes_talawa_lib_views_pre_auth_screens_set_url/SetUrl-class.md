# SetUrl class


This widget lets a user sign in/up with the organization url.

The user can enter an organization through the QR code scanner,
or enter the organization URL and then login.
There is also a signup option which navigates to a screen for the user
to select an organization.
At the bottom, there is also a gesture detector for changing the language.
