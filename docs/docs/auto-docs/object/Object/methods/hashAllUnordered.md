# Method: `hashAllUnordered`

## Description

Creates a combined hash code for a collection of objects.

 The hash code is computed for elements in [objects],
 even if they are `null`,
 by numerically combining the [Object.hashCode] of each element
 in an order independent way.

 The result of `` is not `o.hashCode`.

 Example:
 ```dart
 bool setEquals&lt;T&gt;(Set&lt;T> set1, Set<T&gt; set2) 
 ```

 The computed value will be consistent when the function is called
 again with objects that have the same hash codes
 during an execution of a single program,
 even if the objects are not necessarily in the same order,

 The hash value generated by this function is *not* guaranteed to be stable
 over different runs of the same program.
 The exact algorithm used may differ between different platforms,
 or between different versions of the platform libraries,
 and it may depend on values that change on each program execution.

## Return Type
`int`

## Parameters

- `objects`: `Iterable<Object?>`
