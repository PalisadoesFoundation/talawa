# Method: `toString`

## Description

A string representation of this object.

 Some classes have a default textual representation,
 often paired with a static `parse` function (like [int.parse]).
 These classes will provide the textual representation as
 their string representation.

 Other classes have no meaningful textual representation
 that a program will care about.
 Such classes will typically override `toString` to provide
 useful information when inspecting the object,
 mainly for debugging or logging.

## Return Type
`String`
