# Method: `hash`

## Description

Creates a combined hash code for a number of objects.

 The hash code is computed for all arguments that are actually
 supplied, even if they are `null`, by numerically combining the
 [Object.hashCode] of each argument.

 Example:
 ```dart
 class SomeObject 
 ```

 The computed value will be consistent when the function is called
 with the same arguments multiple times
 during the execution of a single program.

 The hash value generated by this function is *not* guaranteed to be stable
 over different runs of the same program,
 or between code run in different isolates of the same program.
 The exact algorithm used may differ between different platforms,
 or between different versions of the platform libraries,
 and it may depend on values that change on each program execution.

 The [hashAll] function gives the same result as this function when
 called with a collection containing the actual arguments
 to this function in the same order.
