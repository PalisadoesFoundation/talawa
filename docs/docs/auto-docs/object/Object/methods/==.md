# Method: `==`

## Description

The equality operator.

 The default behavior for all [Object]s is to return true if and
 only if this object and [other] are the same object.

 Override this method to specify a different equality relation on
 a class. The overriding method must still be an equivalence relation.
 That is, it must be:

  * Total: It must return a boolean for all arguments. It should never throw.

  * Reflexive: For all objects `o`, `o == o` must be true.

  * Symmetric: For all objects `o1` and `o2`, `o1 == o2` and `o2 == o1` must
    either both be true, or both be false.

  * Transitive: For all objects `o1`, `o2`, and `o3`, if `o1 == o2` and
    `o2 == o3` are true, then `o1 == o3` must be true.

 The method should also be consistent over time,
 so whether two objects are equal should only change
 if at least one of the objects was modified.

 If a subclass overrides the equality operator, it should override
 the [hashCode] method as well to maintain consistency.

## Return Type
