# Method: `debugOutstandingSemanticsHandles`

## Description

Deprecated.

 Use [SemanticsBinding.debugOutstandingSemanticsHandles] instead. This
 API is broken because an outstanding semantics handle on a given pipeline
 owner doesn't mean that semantics are actually produced.

## Return Type
`int`
