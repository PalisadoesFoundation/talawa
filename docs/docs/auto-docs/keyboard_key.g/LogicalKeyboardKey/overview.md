# Overview for `LogicalKeyboardKey`

## Description

A class with static values that describe the keys that are returned from
 [RawKeyEvent.logicalKey].

 These represent *logical* keys, which are keys which are interpreted in the
 context of any modifiers, modes, or keyboard layouts which may be in effect.

 This is contrast to [PhysicalKeyboardKey], which represents a physical key
 in a particular location on the keyboard, without regard for the modifier
 state, mode, or keyboard layout.

 As an example, if you wanted to implement an app where the "Q" key "quit"
 something, you'd want to look at the logical key to detect this, since you
 would like to have it match the key with "Q" on it, instead of always
 looking for "the key next to the TAB key", since on a French keyboard,
 the key next to the TAB key has an "A" on it.

 Conversely, if you wanted a game where the key next to the CAPS LOCK (the
 "A" key on a QWERTY keyboard) moved the player to the left, you'd want to
 look at the physical key to make sure that regardless of the character the
 key produces, you got the key that is in that location on the keyboard.

 
 This example shows how to detect if the user has selected the logical "Q"
 key and handle the key if they have.
