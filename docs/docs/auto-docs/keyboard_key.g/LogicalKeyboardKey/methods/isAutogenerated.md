# Method: `isAutogenerated`

## Description

Returns true if the [keyId] of this object is one that is auto-generated by
 Flutter.

 Auto-generated key IDs are generated in response to platform key codes
 which Flutter doesn't recognize, and their IDs shouldn't be used in a
 persistent way.

 Auto-generated IDs should be a rare occurrence: Flutter supports most keys.

 Keys that generate Unicode characters (even if unknown to Flutter) will
 not return true for [isAutogenerated], since they will be assigned a
 Unicode-based code that will remain stable.

 If Flutter adds support for a previously unsupported key code, the ID it
 reports will change, but the ID will remain stable on the platform it is
 produced on until Flutter adds support for recognizing it.

 So, hypothetically, if Android added a new key code of 0xffff,
 representing a new "do what I mean" key, then the auto-generated code
 would be 0x1020000ffff, but once Flutter added the "doWhatIMean" key to
 the definitions below, the new code would be 0x0020000ffff for all
 platforms that had a "do what I mean" key from then on.

## Return Type
`bool`
