# Method: `selectPosition`

## Description

Move selection to the location of the last tap down.

 
 This method is mainly used to translate user inputs in global positions
 into a [TextSelection]. When used in conjunction with a [EditableText],
 the selection change is fed back into [TextEditingController.selection].

 If you have a [TextEditingController], it's generally easier to
 programmatically manipulate its `value` or `selection` directly.
 

## Return Type
`void`

## Parameters

- ``: `dynamic`
