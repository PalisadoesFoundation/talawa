Returns a one-line detailed description of the object.

This description is often somewhat long. This includes the same
information given by
[toStringDeep](../../views_pre_auth_screens_select_organization/SelectOrganization/toStringDeep.md),
but does not recurse to any children.

`joiner` specifies the string which is place between each part obtained
from
[debugFillProperties](../../views_pre_auth_screens_select_organization/SelectOrganization/debugFillProperties.md).
Passing a string such as `'\n '` will result in a multiline string that
indents the properties of the object below its name (as per
[toString](../../views_pre_auth_screens_select_organization/SelectOrganization/toString.md)).

`minLevel` specifies the minimum `DiagnosticLevel` for properties
included in the output.

See also:

- [toString](../../views_pre_auth_screens_select_organization/SelectOrganization/toString.md),
  for a brief description of the object.
- [toStringDeep](../../views_pre_auth_screens_select_organization/SelectOrganization/toStringDeep.md),
  for a description of the subtree rooted at this object.
