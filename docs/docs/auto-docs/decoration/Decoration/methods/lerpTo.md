# Method: `lerpTo`

## Description

Linearly interpolates from `this` to another [Decoration] (which may be of
 a different class).

 This is called if `b`'s [lerpFrom] did not know how to handle this class.

 When implementing this method in subclasses, return null if this class
 cannot interpolate from `b`. In that case, [lerp] will apply a default
 behavior instead. Classes should implement both [lerpFrom] and [lerpTo].

 Supporting interpolating to null is recommended as the [Decoration.lerp]
 method uses this as a fallback when two classes can't interpolate between
 each other.

 The `t` argument represents position on the timeline, with 0.0 meaning
 that the interpolation has not started, returning `this` (or something
 equivalent to `this`), 1.0 meaning that the interpolation has finished,
 returning `b` (or something equivalent to `b`), and values in between
 meaning that the interpolation is at the relevant point on the timeline
 between `this` and `b`. The interpolation can be extrapolated beyond 0.0
 and 1.0, so negative values and values greater than 1.0 are valid (and can
 easily be generated by curves such as [Curves.elasticInOut]).

 Values for `t` are usually obtained from an [Animation&lt;double&gt;], such as
 an [AnimationController].

 Instead of calling this directly, use [Decoration.lerp].

## Return Type
