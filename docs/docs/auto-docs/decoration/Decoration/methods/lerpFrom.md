# Method: `lerpFrom`

## Description

Linearly interpolates from another [Decoration] (which may be of a
 different class) to `this`.

 When implementing this method in subclasses, return null if this class
 cannot interpolate from `a`. In that case, [lerp] will try `a`'s [lerpTo]
 method instead. Classes should implement both [lerpFrom] and [lerpTo].

 Supporting interpolating from null is recommended as the [Decoration.lerp]
 method uses this as a fallback when two classes can't interpolate between
 each other.

 The `t` argument represents position on the timeline, with 0.0 meaning
 that the interpolation has not started, returning `a` (or something
 equivalent to `a`), 1.0 meaning that the interpolation has finished,
 returning `this` (or something equivalent to `this`), and values in
 between meaning that the interpolation is at the relevant point on the
 timeline between `a` and `this`. The interpolation can be extrapolated
 beyond 0.0 and 1.0, so negative values and values greater than 1.0 are
 valid (and can easily be generated by curves such as
 [Curves.elasticInOut]).

 Values for `t` are usually obtained from an [Animation&lt;double&gt;], such as
 an [AnimationController].

 Instead of calling this directly, use [Decoration.lerp].

## Return Type
`Decoration?`

## Parameters

- `a`: `Decoration?`
- `t`: `double`
