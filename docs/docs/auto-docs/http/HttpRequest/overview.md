# Overview for `HttpRequest`

## Description

A server-side object
 that contains the content of and information about an HTTP request.

 `HttpRequest` objects are generated by an [HttpServer],
 which listens for HTTP requests on a specific host and port.
 For each request received, the HttpServer, which is a [Stream],
 generates an `HttpRequest` object and adds it to the stream.

 An `HttpRequest` object delivers the body content of the request
 as a stream of byte lists.
 The object also contains information about the request,
 such as the method, URI, and headers.

 In the following code, an HttpServer listens
 for HTTP requests. When the server receives a request,
 it uses the HttpRequest object's `method` property to dispatch requests.

     final HOST = InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4;
     final PORT = 80;

     HttpServer.bind(HOST, PORT).then((_server) ).catchError(handleError);

 An HttpRequest object provides access to the associated [HttpResponse]
 object through the response property.
 The server writes its response to the body of the HttpResponse object.
 For example, here's a function that responds to a request:

     void handleGetRequest(HttpRequest req)
