# Method: `add`

## Description

Adds byte [data] to the target consumer, ignoring [encoding].

 The [encoding] does not apply to this method, and the [data] list is passed
 directly to the target consumer as a stream event.

 This method must not be called when a stream is currently being added
 using [addStream].

 This operation is non-blocking. See [flush] or [done] for how to get any
 errors generated by this call.

 The data list should not be modified after it has been passed to `add`
 because it is not defined whether the target consumer will receive the
 list in the original or modified state.

 Individual values in [data] which are not in the range 0 .. 255 will be
 truncated to their low eight bits, as if by [int.toUnsigned], before being
 used.

## Return Type
`void`

## Parameters

- `data`: `List&lt;int&gt;`
