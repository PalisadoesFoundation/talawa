# Overview for `UnsignedShort`

## Description

The C `unsigned short` type.

 Typically an unsigned 16-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 16-bit integer, use [Uint16] with the C `uint16_t` type.
 For a signed `short`, use [Short].

 The [UnsignedShort] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
