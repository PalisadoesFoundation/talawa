# Overview for `Int`

## Description

The C `int` type.

 Typically a signed 32-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 32-bit integer, use [Int32] with the C `int32_t` type.
 For an `unsigned int`, use [UnsignedInt].

 The [Int] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
