# Overview for `UnsignedLongLong`

## Description

The C `unsigned long long` type.

 Typically an unsigned 64-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 64-bit integer, use [Uint64] with the C `uint64_t` type.
 For a signed `long long`, use [LongLong].

 The [UnsignedLongLong] type is a native type, and should not be constructed
 in Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
