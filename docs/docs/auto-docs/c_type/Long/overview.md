# Overview for `Long`

## Description

The C `long int`, aka. `long`, type.

 Typically a signed 32- or 64-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 32-bit integer, use [Int32] with the C `int32_t` type.
 For a guaranteed 64-bit integer, use [Int64] with the C `int64_t` type.
 For an `unsigned long`, use [UnsignedLong].

 The [Long] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
