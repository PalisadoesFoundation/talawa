# Overview for `Char`

## Description

The C `char` type.

 Typically a signed or unsigned 8-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 8-bit integer, use [Int8] with the C `int8_t` type
 or [Uint8] with the C `uint8_t` type.
 For a specifically `signed` or `unsigned` `char`, use [SignedChar] or
 [UnsignedChar].

 The [Char] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
