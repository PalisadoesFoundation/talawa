# Overview for `WChar`

## Description

The C `wchar_t` type.

 The signedness of `wchar_t` is undefined in C. Here, it is exposed as the
 defaults on the tested [Abi]s.

 The [WChar] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
