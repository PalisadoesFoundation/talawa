# Overview for `UnsignedChar`

## Description

The C `unsigned char` type.

 Typically an unsigned 8-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 8-bit integer, use [Uint8] with the C `uint8_t` type.
 For a `signed char`, use [SignedChar].

 The [UnsignedChar] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
