# Overview for `UnsignedLong`

## Description

The C `unsigned long int`, aka. `unsigned long`, type.

 Typically an unsigned 32- or 64-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 32-bit integer, use [Uint32] with the C `uint32_t` type.
 For a guaranteed 64-bit integer, use [Uint64] with the C `uint64_t` type.
 For a signed `long`, use [Long].

 The [UnsignedLong] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
