# Overview for `Short`

## Description

The C `short` type.

 Typically a signed 16-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 16-bit integer, use [Int16] with the C `int16_t` type.
 For an `unsigned short`, use [UnsignedShort].

 The [Short] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
