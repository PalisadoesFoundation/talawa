# Overview for `UnsignedInt`

## Description

The C `unsigned int` type.

 Typically an unsigned 32-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 32-bit integer, use [Uint32] with the C `uint32_t` type.
 For a signed `int`, use [Int].

 The [UnsignedInt] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
