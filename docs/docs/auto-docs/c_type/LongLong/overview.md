# Overview for `LongLong`

## Description

The C `long long` type.

 Typically a signed 64-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 64-bit integer, use [Int64] with the C `int64_t` type.
 For an `unsigned long long`, use [UnsignedLongLong].

 The [LongLong] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
