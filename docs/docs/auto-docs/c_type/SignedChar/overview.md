# Overview for `SignedChar`

## Description

The C `signed char` type.

 Typically a signed 8-bit integer.
 For a guaranteed 8-bit integer, use [Int8] with the C `int8_t` type.
 For an `unsigned char`, use [UnsignedChar].

 The [SignedChar] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
 Dart code.
 It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on [Struct] and
 [Union] fields.
