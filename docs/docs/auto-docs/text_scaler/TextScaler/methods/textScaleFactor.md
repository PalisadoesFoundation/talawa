# Method: `textScaleFactor`

## Description

The estimated number of font pixels for each logical pixel. This property
 exists only for backward compatibility purposes, and will be removed in
 a future version of Flutter.

 The value of this property is only an estimate, so it may not reflect the
 exact text scaling strategy this [TextScaler] represents, especially when
 this [TextScaler] is not linear. Consider using [TextScaler.scale] instead.

## Return Type
`double`
