# Overview for `UniqueWidget`

## Description

Base class for stateful widgets that have exactly one inflated instance in
 the tree.

 Such widgets must be given a [GlobalKey]. This key can be generated by the
 subclass from its [Type] object, e.g. by calling `super(key: new
 GlobalObjectKey(MyWidget))` where `MyWidget` is the name of the subclass.

 Since only one instance can be inflated at a time, there is only ever one
 corresponding [State] object. That object is exposed, for convenience, via
 the [currentState] property.

 When subclassing [UniqueWidget], provide the corresponding [State] subclass
 as the type argument.

## Dependencies

- StatefulWidget

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Creates a widget that has exactly one inflated instance in the tree.

 The [key] argument is required because it identifies the unique inflated
 instance of this widget.
