# Method: `pushOpacity`

## Description

Pushes an opacity operation onto the operation stack.

 The given alpha value is blended into the alpha value of the objects'
 rasterization. An alpha value of 0 makes the objects entirely invisible.
 An alpha value of 255 has no effect (i.e., the objects retain the current
 opacity).

 

 

 See [pop] for details about the operation stack.
