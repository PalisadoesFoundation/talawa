# Overview for `Command`

## Description

An object sent from the Flutter Driver to a Flutter application to instruct
 the application to perform a task.

## Members

- **timeout**: `Duration?`
  The maximum amount of time to wait for the command to complete.

 Defaults to no timeout, because it is common for operations to take oddly
 long in test environments (e.g. because the test host is overloaded), and
 having timeouts essentially means having race conditions.

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Abstract const constructor. This constructor enables subclasses to provide
 const constructors so that they can be used in const expressions.

### deserialize
Deserializes this command from the value generated by [serialize].

#### Parameters

- `json`: `Map&lt;String, String&gt;`
