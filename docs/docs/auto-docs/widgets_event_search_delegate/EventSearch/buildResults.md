The results shown after the user submits a search from the search page.

The current value of
[query](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/query.html)
can be used to determine what the user searched for.

This method might be applied more than once to the same query. If your
[buildResults](../../widgets_event_search_delegate/EventSearch/buildResults.md)
method is computationally expensive, you may want to cache the search
results for one or more queries.

Typically, this method returns a
[ListView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
with the search results. When the user taps on a particular search
result,
[close](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/close.html)
should be called with the selected result as argument. This will close
the search page and communicate the result back to the initial caller of
[showSearch](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showSearch.html).
