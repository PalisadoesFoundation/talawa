override




Suggestions shown in the body of the search page while the user types a
query into the search field.

The delegate method is called whenever the content of
[query](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/query.html)
changes. The suggestions should be based on the current
[query](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/query.html)
string. If the query string is empty, it is good practice to show
suggested queries based on past queries or the current context.

Usually, this method will return a
[ListView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
with one
[ListTile](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html)
per suggestion. When
[ListTile.onTap](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile/onTap.html)
is called,
[query](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/query.html)
should be updated with the corresponding suggestion and the results page
should be shown by calling
[showResults](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/showResults.html).
