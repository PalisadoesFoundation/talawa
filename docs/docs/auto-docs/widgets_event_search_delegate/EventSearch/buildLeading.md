override




A widget to display before the current query in the
[AppBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html).

Typically an
[IconButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html)
configured with a
[BackButtonIcon](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BackButtonIcon-class.html)
that exits the search with
[close](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/close.html).
One can also use an
[AnimatedIcon](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AnimatedIcon-class.html)
driven by
[transitionAnimation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate/transitionAnimation.html),
which animates from e.g. a hamburger menu to the back button as the
search overlay fades in.

Returns null if no widget should be shown.
