# Method: `currentResult`

## Description

When this route is popped (see [Navigator.pop]) if the result isn't
 specified or if it's null, this value will be used instead.

 This fallback is implemented by [didComplete]. This value is used if the
 argument to that method is null.

## Return Type
`T?`
