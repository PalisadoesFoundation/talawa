# Method: `crossAxisPadding`

## Description

The total padding in the cross-axis direction. (In other words, for a
 vertical downwards-growing list, the sum of the padding on the left and
 right.)

 Only valid after layout has started, since before layout the render object
 doesn't know what direction it will be laid out in.

## Return Type
`double`
