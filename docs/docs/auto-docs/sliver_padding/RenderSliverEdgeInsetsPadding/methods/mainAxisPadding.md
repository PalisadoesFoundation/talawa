# Method: `mainAxisPadding`

## Description

The total padding in the [SliverConstraints.axisDirection]. (In other
 words, for a vertical downwards-growing list, the sum of the padding on
 the top and bottom.)

 Only valid after layout has started, since before layout the render object
 doesn't know what direction it will be laid out in.

## Return Type
`double`
