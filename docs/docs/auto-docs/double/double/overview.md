# Overview for `double`

## Description

A double-precision floating point number.

 Representation of Dart doubles containing double specific constants
 and operations and specializations of operations inherited from
 [num]. Dart doubles are 64-bit floating-point numbers as specified in the
 IEEE 754 standard.

 The [double] type is contagious. Operations on [double]s return
 [double] results.

 It is a compile-time error for a class to attempt to extend or implement
 double.
