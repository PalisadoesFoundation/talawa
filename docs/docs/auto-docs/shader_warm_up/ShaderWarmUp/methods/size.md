# Method: `size`

## Description

The size of the warm up image.

 The exact size shouldn't matter much as long as all draws are onscreen.
 100x100 is an arbitrary small size that's easy to fit significant draw
 calls onto.

 A custom shader warm up can override this based on targeted devices.

## Return Type
`ui.Size`
