# Method: `rotation`

## Description

The rotation in clockwise degrees around the center of the shape.

 The rotation occurs before the [squash] effect is applied, so that you can
 fine tune where the points of a star or corners of a polygon start.

 Defaults to zero, meaning that the first point or corner is pointing up.

## Return Type
`double`
