# toString method


String
toString()
inherited

A string representation of this object.

Some classes have a default textual representation,
often paired with a static `parse` function (like `int.parse`).
These classes will provide the textual representation as
their string representation.

Other classes have no meaningful textual representation
that a program will care about.
Such classes will typically override `toString` to provide
useful information when inspecting the object,
mainly for debugging or logging.


## Implementation

```
external String toString();
```
