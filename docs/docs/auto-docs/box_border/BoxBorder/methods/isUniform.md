# Method: `isUniform`

## Description

Whether all four sides of the border are identical. Uniform borders are
 typically more efficient to paint.

 A uniform border by definition has no text direction dependency and
 therefore could be expressed as a [Border], even if it is currently a
 [BorderDirectional]. A uniform border can also be expressed as a
 [RoundedRectangleBorder].

## Return Type
`bool`
