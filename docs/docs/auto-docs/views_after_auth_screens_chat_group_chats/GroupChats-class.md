# GroupChats class

GroupChats returns a StatelessWidget for rendering all the group chats
of the current user in the Chat List Screen.

This widget displays either an empty state when no group chats are
available or a scrollable list of group chat tiles when group chats
exist. It includes pull-to-refresh functionality for updating the group
chat list.

Group chats are defined as chats with 3 or more members.
