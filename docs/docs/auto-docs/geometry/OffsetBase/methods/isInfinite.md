# Method: `isInfinite`

## Description

Returns true if either component is [double.infinity], and false if both
 are finite (or negative infinity, or NaN).

 This is different than comparing for equality with an instance that has
 _both_ components set to [double.infinity].

 See also:

  * [isFinite], which is true if both components are finite (and not NaN).

## Return Type
`bool`
