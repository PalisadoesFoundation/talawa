# Method: `lerp`

## Description

Linearly interpolate between two Flutter logo descriptions.

 Interpolates both the color and the style in a continuous fashion.

 If both values are null, this returns null. Otherwise, it returns a
 non-null value. If one of the values is null, then the result is obtained
 by scaling the other value's opacity and [margin].
