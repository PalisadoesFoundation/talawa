# BaseFeedManager\<[T\>] class [abstract](https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#abstract "This type can not be directly constructed.")

</div>


An abstract base class for managing a feed of type `T` with caching and
online data fetching capabilities.

This class provides methods for initializing a cache, loading cached
data, saving data to cache, and fetching new data from an API. It also
handles automatic cache refreshing when online.

**params**:

-   `cacheKey`: A unique key for identifying the cache box in Hive.

**methods**:

-   `loadCachedData`: Loads the data cached in Hive for the specified
    [cacheKey](../services_caching_base_feed_manager/BaseFeedManager/cacheKey.md).
-   `saveDataToCache`: Saves a list of data to the cache, clearing any
    existing data in the process.
-   `fetchDataFromApi`: Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
    for fetching data from an API.
-   `getNewFeedAndRefreshCache`: Fetches new data from the API if
    online, updates the cache, and returns the data. If offline, it
    loads and returns cached data.
