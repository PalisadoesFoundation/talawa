# shouldEncrypt property


[bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html)
shouldEncrypt
getter/setter pair

A global switch to flag the encryption.

Since adding encryption invalidates all of the previous
data, disabling it by default will help in keeping
other contributors working without any issue.
TODO: Remove this and make encryption default.


## Implementation

```
static bool shouldEncrypt = false;
```
