# Method: `start`

## Description

Starts the [Stopwatch].

 The [elapsed] count increases monotonically. If the [Stopwatch] has
 been stopped, then calling start again restarts it without resetting the
 [elapsed] count.

 If the [Stopwatch] is currently running, then calling start does nothing.

## Return Type
`void`
