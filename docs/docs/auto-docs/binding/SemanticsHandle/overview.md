# Overview for `SemanticsHandle`

## Description

A reference to the semantics information generated by the framework.

 Semantics information are only collected when there are clients interested
 in them. These clients express their interest by holding a
 [SemanticsHandle]. When the client no longer needs the
 semantics information, it must call [dispose] on the [SemanticsHandle] to
 close it. When all open [SemanticsHandle]s are disposed, the framework will
 stop updating the semantics information.

 To obtain a [SemanticsHandle], call [SemanticsBinding.ensureSemantics].
