# Overview for `SemanticsService`

## Description

Allows access to the platform's accessibility services.

 Events sent by this service are handled by the platform-specific
 accessibility bridge in Flutter's engine.

 When possible, prefer using mechanisms like [Semantics] to implicitly
 trigger announcements over using this event.
