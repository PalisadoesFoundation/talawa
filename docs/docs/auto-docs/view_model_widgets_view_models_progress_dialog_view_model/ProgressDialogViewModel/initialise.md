Initializes the state of the component by checking the online status and
updating the view accordingly.

This method performs the following actions:

1.  Sets the view state to busy to indicate that an initialization
    process is underway.
2.  Checks the online status of the application.
    -   If the app is offline, it sets the `connectivityPresent` flag to
        `false`.
    -   If the app is online, it sets the `connectivityPresent` flag to
        `true`.
3.  Updates the view state to idle after the online status check is
    complete.

**params**: None

**returns**: None
