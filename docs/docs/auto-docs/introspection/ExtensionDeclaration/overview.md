# Overview for `ExtensionDeclaration`

## Description

The class for introspecting on an extension.

 Note that extensions do not actually introduce a new type, but we model them
 as [ParameterizedTypeDeclaration]s anyway, because they generally look
 exactly like other type declarations, and are treated the same.

## Dependencies

- ParameterizedTypeDeclaration, Declaration
