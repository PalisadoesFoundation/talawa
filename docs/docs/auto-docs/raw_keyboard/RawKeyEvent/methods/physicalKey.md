# Method: `physicalKey`

## Description

Returns an object representing the physical location of this key.

 
 The [PhysicalKeyboardKey] ignores the key map, modifier keys (like SHIFT),
 and the label on the key. It describes the location of the key as if it
 were on a QWERTY keyboard regardless of the keyboard mapping in effect.

 [PhysicalKeyboardKey]s are used to describe and test for keys in a
 particular location.

 For instance, if you wanted to make a game where the key to the right of
 the CAPS LOCK key made the player move left, you would be comparing the
 result of this [physicalKey] with [PhysicalKeyboardKey.keyA], since that
 is the key next to the CAPS LOCK key on a QWERTY keyboard. This would
 return the same thing even on a French keyboard where the key next to the
 CAPS LOCK produces a "Q" when pressed.

 If you want to make your app respond to a key with a particular character
 on it regardless of location of the key, use [RawKeyEvent.logicalKey] instead.
 

 See also:

  * [logicalKey] for the non-location specific key generated by this event.
  * [character] for the character generated by this keypress (if any).
