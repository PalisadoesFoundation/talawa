# Method: `isPositioned`

## Description

Whether this child is considered positioned.

 A child is positioned if any of the top, right, bottom, or left properties
 are non-null. Positioned children do not factor into determining the size
 of the stack but are instead placed relative to the non-positioned
 children in the stack.

## Return Type
`bool`
