## Feature 01: Group personal events vs organization wide events

_Authored by_ _ **Shannika Jackson** _ _Last updated on_ _ **March 13, 2021** _

This feature aims to_ **improve the event viewing options** _ by _ **allowing users to group different types of events** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **All events in the organisation is currently displayed ungrouped :** Ideally, the user should be able to
  1. Toggle between their subscribed events or all events in the organization

### Goals

1. **Provide a more streamlined event display :** This should allow modularity for feature development in event management

### Out of Scope

The following are aspects of this feature which have been considered but are outside of the scope for the current project:

1. **Tag events :** This will eventually allow a user to subscribe to, toggle display of and get notifications for specific types of events
2. **Toggle personal event view, co-ordinator, organization and all views on calendar :** This will allow the user to switch between the different views based on their roles.

### People and Roles

The following are the primary roles foreseen in the development of this feature

1. **Feature Lead** : will review proposed solutions, acceptance and close feature .

## Context

NA

### Use Cases

1. **Members want to:**
  1. **Toggle the view of their events** between their subscribed events and all events in the organisation for which they have permission to view (public events and private ones they have been accepted to).
2. **Admins want to** :
  1. **Toggle view of all events** between public or private
  2. **View all members&#39; personal events**
3. Coordinators want to:
  1. **Toggle view of their events:** between their coordinated events and all organization&#39;s events.

## Proposal/Solution

### User Experience

1. From the home screen users should be presented with a button to view events.
2. This view defaults to display all events for which the user is subscribed.
3. The user should be presented with the option to toggle between viewing all events, only their subscribed events and only their coordinated events.

## Feature 02: Event signup and subscription

_Authored by_ _ **Shannika Jackson** _ _Last updated on_ _ **March 13, 2021** _

This feature aims to _ **streamline member event subscription** _ by _ **simplifying how members elect to join/ subscribe to events** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Currently the user cannot subscribe to or sign up as an attendee of an event :**
  1. All events in the organization are presented ungrouped to the user
  2. The user cannot subscribe/ sign up for an event

### Goals

1. **Provide streamlined display of events:** This should eventually facilitate the development of other event-type specific features

### Out of Scope

The following are aspects of this feature which have been considered but are outside of the scope for the current project:

1. **Invite non-app users to events :** Prompting then to install the app and join the organization and subscribe for the event.
2. **View assigned tasks from the event screen/page:** User is able to select an event and see all tasks assigned to then for that event
3. **Volunteer for tasks under an event :** From the events screen/page the user is able volunteer for the listed tasks under the event

### People and Roles

  2. **View the number of subscribers/ attendees for events:**
2. **Coordinators want to** :
  1. **View attendee/ subscription lists for events:** allowing them to assign these members to tasks under the event.

## Proposal/Solution

### User Experience
