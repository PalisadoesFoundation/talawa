# Installation for Developers
Welcome to our installation guide for developers. Jump in and contribute!

## Prerequisites

You'll need to set up the IDE and mobile device emulator on your local system and have access to a system running the Talawa API, which the mobile needs to access to operate properly.

1. **Development Environment**: You'll need to have the following installed:
    1. [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
1. **API Environment**: You will need to enter the URL of the API server in the Talawa app when it first starts up. The URL could be active on a system you control or in our test environment.
    1. *Your API Server:* Check the [Talawa API repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) for information on how to set up the API on your local machine or a machine under your legitimate control. There is a section in the README.md file that discusses installation.
    2. *Our API Server for Talawa Contributors*: We also have a test environment that our open source contributors use. Try it if you are not inclined to set up or customize your own API server. This is a development environment. The data stored on this server may be modified or deleted without warning. Information about this server can be found on the [Talawa documentation site](https://palisadoesfoundation.github.io/talawa-docs/).
    
(Optional) **Google APIs**: The app uses Google Maps API for venue selection. You will need to sign up for it if you want to test these features. Enter your API key in the
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file for android.
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file for iOS.

Replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your API key.

**Remember** to remove the key before committing changes and replace again with YOUR_KEY_HERE.

- Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
- Create a new project that you want to enable Google Maps on.
- Search `credentials` in the search bar and select `Credentials` in APIs & Services. Click on `Create credentials` and select `API key`. Copy the key and replace it as said before.
- Search `maps sdk for android` and select the `Google Maps SDK for Android` in Marketplace. You can also search `maps sdk for ios` and select the `Google Maps SDK for iOS` in Marketplace for iOS devices.
- Click `Enable`.

## Command Line Steps

We have tried to make the process simple. Here's what you need to do.

1. Clone and change into the project.
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa.git
    $ cd talawa
    ```
1. Install packages.
    ```sh
    $ flutter pub get
    ```
1. Start developing!

## Developer Environment Setup

Talawa mobile app requires [talawa-api](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) running locally or remotely, which will be used as an `organisation url`. 

#### On Your Local Machine

You need to setup your own local instance of [Talawa-API](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) and [Talawa-admin](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin). The advantage is that you'll be working with the latest code.

1. You need to setup all the 3 projects locally ([talawa](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa), [talawa-api](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api), and [talawa-admin](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin)), refer the INSTALLATION.md of the respective repository for further guide.
2. After setting up [talawa-api](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) and [talawa-admin](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin) create a user account in talawa admin. user account is necessary for creating organization which will be needed during development time.
3. After creating an user account in talawa admin, edit data in `MongoDB document` under users collection by changing `userType` from ADMIN to SUPERADMIN and `adminApproved` from false to true. For that go to your `MongoDB` dashboard -> select your project -> click Browse `collection` -> select `users` collection and make the changes. This is done so that you will get authorized to create and manage an organization. refer the image below.

4. After user account creation, login to your account and create an `organization` in talawa-admin by clicking create organization button on the top corner

5. Then use the URL (Organization URL) in this form:
    1. http://(IP-address):4000/graphql (See the below example) 
    1. Example : http://10.0.2.2:4000/graphql
